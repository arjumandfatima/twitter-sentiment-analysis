# twitter-sentiment-analysis
A sample python application for finding tweet polarity. The input dataset can be in the form of .xlsx file or .dbf file. A .dbf file can be read and processed directly using the `get_tweets_dbf(fileName) ` function. In case you want to convert a .dbf file to .xlsx first, you can use `dbf_to_xlsx(fileName)` method.
